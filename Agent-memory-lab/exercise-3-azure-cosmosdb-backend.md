# Exercise 3: Azure Cosmos DB Backend

### Estimated Duration: 75 Minutes

## 📘 Scenario

In the first two exercises, you stored agent memory in a **SQLite** database — a file that lives directly on your local machine. That works perfectly for learning and prototyping, but it has a fundamental limitation: the moment you close the session or restart the machine, the data is tied to that single device. No other application, user, or cloud service can reach it.

In this exercise, you will move the **same agent memory system** to **Azure Cosmos DB** — a fully managed, cloud-hosted database that stores data as JSON documents and keeps that data available 24/7 from anywhere. You will run the same financial advisor scenario you used in Exercise 2, but this time everything the agent learns is stored in the cloud. You will then run a second notebook that shows how to keep the agent's long-term memory *bounded* — capping the number of insights so the agent stays sharp rather than accumulating noise forever.

The key insight of this exercise is simple: **you only change one thing** — the backend configuration. All the memory logic, the agent, and the conversation code stay exactly the same.

## 📖 Overview

In this exercise, you will:

- Understand why a cloud backend is needed and how it differs from SQLite
- Review and verify the Cosmos DB connection settings in your `.env` file
- Run the `04_cosmosdb.ipynb` notebook to see cloud-backed memory in action
- Verify that data was actually saved to Cosmos DB using the Azure Portal
- Run the `09_itemized_insights_cosmos.ipynb` notebook to see bounded long-term memory with a scoring and forgetting system
- Review the four supported backends and understand when to choose each one

## 🎯 Objectives

In this exercise, you will perform:

- Task 3.1: Understand Backend Options
- Task 3.2: Run the Cosmos DB Demo
- Task 3.3: Verify Data Persisted in Cosmos DB
- Task 3.4: Run Itemized Insights with Cosmos DB
- Task 3.5: Concept Check — Backend Selection Trade-offs

## Task 3.1: Understand Backend Options

In this task, you will learn what a **backend** means in Agent Memory, understand why Cosmos DB is needed for production workloads, confirm the Cosmos DB credentials in your `.env` file, and navigate to the pre-created Cosmos DB account in the Azure Portal.

### What is a backend?

A **backend** is where Agent Memory physically stores its data — turns, summaries, session records, and insights. Think of it as the filing cabinet. The rest of the code (the agent, the memory API, the context injection) does not change when you swap the backend. You simply tell `AgentMemory` which type of database to use, and it handles the rest.

The project supports four backend options:

| Backend | Where data lives | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `sqlite` | A `.db` file on your local machine | Learning, demos, local prototyping |
| `cosmosdb` | Azure cloud — a managed JSON document database | Production agents, multi-session apps, cloud deployments |
| `azure_ai_search` | Azure cloud — a search-optimized index | When semantic/vector retrieval quality is the top priority |
| `postgresql` | A SQL database (local or cloud) | Teams that already use Postgres in their stack |

You used `sqlite` in Exercises 1 and 2. In this exercise you switch to `cosmosdb`.

### What makes Cosmos DB different from SQLite?

| | SQLite | Cosmos DB |
|---|---|---|
| Where it runs | On your machine, as a file | In the Azure cloud |
| Who can access it | Only your local process | Any app, user, or service with credentials |
| What happens when you restart | Data stays on your machine | Data stays in the cloud — always available |
| Cost | Free (a local file) | Azure consumption-based pricing |
| Best use | Prototyping | Production, multi-user, or deployed apps |

### Steps

1. In the Explorer pane, click on the **.env** file in the project root to open it.

1. Confirm the following **Azure OpenAI** variables are present and populated (you configured these in Exercise 1):

   - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_REASONING_MODEL`
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_DEPLOYMENT`

1. Now look for the **Cosmos DB** variables. The notebook accepts either of these two authentication options:

   **Option A — Connection String (most common in lab environments):**
   ```
   COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING=AccountEndpoint=https://...
   ```

   **Option B — Endpoint + Key:**
   ```
   COSMOS_ENDPOINT=https://<your-account>.documents.azure.com:443/
   COSMOS_KEY=<your-primary-key>
   ```

   > **Note:** The notebook checks for `COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING` first, then falls back to `COSMOS_ENDPOINT`. If both are missing, the demo will exit immediately with *"CosmosDB credentials not found!"* — that is your signal to check the `.env` file.

1. Open a browser on the lab VM and navigate to the Azure Portal:

   ```
   https://portal.azure.com
   ```

1. Sign in using the lab credentials provided in the **Environment** tab.

1. In the search bar at the top of the Azure Portal, search for **Azure Cosmos DB (1)** and select **Azure Cosmos DB (2)** from the Services section.

1. From the list, click on the pre-provisioned **Cosmos DB account** for this lab.

1. On the **Overview** pane, locate the **URI** — confirm it matches the endpoint value in your `.env` file.

1. From the left navigation pane, select **Keys (1)** under **Settings**. Confirm the **PRIMARY KEY (2)** matches the `COSMOS_KEY` value in your `.env` file.

   > **Note:** Keys in the portal are hidden by default. Click the eye icon next to a key to reveal it for comparison.

1. From the left navigation pane, select **Data Explorer (1)**. At this point the explorer will likely be empty or show only a root node — that is expected. You will return here in Task 3.3 after the demo has run and written data.

   > **Tip:** **Data Explorer** is the portal tool for browsing databases, containers (like folders), and individual JSON items stored in Cosmos DB. Think of it as a file browser for your cloud database.

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
> - Scroll down in the lab guide and hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
> - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
> - If you need any assistance, please contact us at cloudlabs-support@spektrasystems.com. We are available 24/7 to help you out.

## Task 3.2: Run the Cosmos DB Demo

In this task, you will open the `04_cosmosdb.ipynb` notebook, select the kernel, and execute each cell while understanding exactly what each one does. This notebook runs the same three-session financial advisor scenario from Exercise 2, but now all memory is stored in Azure Cosmos DB instead of a local SQLite file.

1. Return to **Visual Studio Code**.

1. In the Explorer pane, navigate to the **demo** folder and open the **04_cosmosdb.ipynb** notebook.

1. Take a moment to read the first markdown cell, **"Demo 4: Financial Advisor with CosmosDB Backend"**. It lists four things this notebook demonstrates:

   - A financial advisor agent with two retirement tools
   - Conversation memory stored in **Cosmos DB**
   - Multiple sessions to demonstrate cross-session recall
   - Final memory search, insights, and session summaries

   It also lists the required environment variables — confirm these match what you verified in Task 3.1.

1. Click **Select Kernel (1)** in the top-right corner and select the project's virtual environment, for example **.venv (Python 3.12.x) (2)**.

1. Run the first code cell (**Cell 1 — Imports and Environment Setup**). This cell:

   - **Imports all required libraries**: `asyncio`, `os`, `sys`, `pathlib`, and `dotenv` for loading the `.env` file.
   - **Fixes text encoding** — ensures emoji and special characters print cleanly in the terminal (`sys.stdout.reconfigure`).
   - **Loads your `.env` file** — this is where the Cosmos DB and Azure OpenAI values from Task 3.1 are read.
   - **Finds the project root** and adds it to `sys.path` so the `memory` package can be imported.
   - **Imports the key classes**: `AzureOpenAI`, `Agent`, `AgentMemory`, `AgentMemoryConfig`, and critically — `DatabaseType` from `memory.db`.
   - **Sets `USER_ID = "sarah_demo_cosmos"`** — this is the unique key that identifies Sarah's memory in Cosmos DB. Every turn, summary, and insight stored by this demo will carry this ID.

   You should see: `Imports and environment setup complete.`

1. Run the second code cell (**Cell 2 — Tools and Session Runner**). This cell:

   - **Defines two financial tools** the agent can call:
     - `get_401k_limit(year)` — returns the 401k contribution limit for a given year (e.g., `"$23,500 (under 50), $31,000 (50+)"` for 2025).
     - `get_roth_ira_limit(year)` — returns the Roth IRA limit.
   - **Defines `run_session()`** — a helper function that starts a memory session, prints the loaded context (prior memory), runs a list of user queries through the agent, ends the session with reflection, and prints how many insights were extracted.

   The key line inside `run_session()` is:

   ```python
   context = await memory.get_context()
   print(f"Memory context loaded ({len(context)} chars):")
   ```

   On Session 1, this will print a small number of characters (no prior history). On Sessions 2 and 3, you will see a larger number — that is Sarah's profile being loaded from Cosmos DB automatically.

   You should see: `Tools and session runner are ready.`

1. Read the markdown cell **"Cell 4: Detailed Execution Plan"** — it describes what the main cell will do step by step before you run it, so you know what to expect.

1. Run the final code cell (**Cell 4 — Main Demo**). This is the cell that actually connects to Cosmos DB and runs the full scenario. Watch the output section by section:

   **Connection check:**
   - The cell first checks for `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` or `COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING`. If neither is found, it prints an error and stops — go back to your `.env` file if this happens.
   - If credentials are found, it prints: `CosmosDB: Endpoint configured` (or `Connection String configured`).

   **Configuration — the key difference from SQLite:**
   ```python
   memory = AgentMemory(
       user_id=USER_ID,
       openai_client=openai_client,
       db_type=DatabaseType.COSMOSDB,        # ← THIS IS THE ONLY CHANGE
       connection_string=cosmos_conn,
       config=config,
   )
   ```
   Everything else — the agent, the tools, the session flow — is identical to the SQLite demo. `db_type=DatabaseType.COSMOSDB` is the single line that switches the backend.

   **Session 1 — Initial Consultation:**
   - Sarah introduces herself: *"I'm Sarah, 35, software engineer making $150,000/year."*
   - Watch the `Memory context loaded (X chars)` line — this should be very short, because there is no prior history for this user yet.
   - At session end: `Insights: N` — the number of facts the system extracted about Sarah.

   **Session 2 — Investment Strategy:**
   - Sarah asks: *"Based on what we discussed before, what asset allocation do you recommend?"*
   - Watch the `Memory context loaded (X chars)` line again — this should now be **larger** than Session 1, because Sarah's profile from Session 1 was retrieved from Cosmos DB.
   - The agent's response should reference Sarah's risk tolerance and 30-year time horizon from Session 1.

   **Session 3 — Tax Planning:**
   - Sarah asks about tax optimization *"given my income and the retirement accounts we discussed."*
   - The context should be even richer, drawing on both Sessions 1 and 2.

   **Final inspection:**
   - `memory.search("What is Sarah's risk tolerance?")` — a semantic search that retrieves the stored answer.
   - `memory.get_sessions()` — all three sessions with their auto-generated summaries.
   - `memory.get_insights()` — the extracted facts about Sarah, each with a category and confidence score.

   You should see the output ending with a cleanup confirmation.

   > **Note:** If the cell fails with a `CosmosDB connection error` or `authentication error`, verify your `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_KEY` values in `.env`, save the file, restart the kernel, and re-run all cells from the top.

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
> - Scroll down in the lab guide and hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
> - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.

## Task 3.3: Verify Data Persisted in Cosmos DB

In this task, you will confirm that the data written in Task 3.2 actually exists in your Azure Cosmos DB account by browsing the containers in Data Explorer, inspecting a stored JSON item, and verifying that memory survives a full kernel restart.

### Why does this matter?

With SQLite, you can check persistence by opening the `.db` file on your local machine. With Cosmos DB, persistence lives in the cloud — the only way to see it directly is through the Azure Portal's **Data Explorer** or the Cosmos DB SDK. This task makes the persistence tangible: you will see the actual JSON documents the notebook wrote.

1. Return to your browser and navigate to the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you opened in Task 3.1.

1. From the left navigation pane, select **Data Explorer (1)**.

1. In the Data Explorer, expand the **agent_memory_db (1)** database node. If you do not see it, click **Refresh** — it may take a few seconds after the notebook run to appear.

1. Inside **agent_memory_db**, expand each container to see what the demo created. You should find containers similar to the following:

   - **interactions** — the raw conversation turns (Sarah's questions and the advisor's answers).
   - **session_summaries** — the auto-generated summaries produced at the end of each session.
   - **insights** — the durable facts extracted about Sarah (risk tolerance, income, retirement timeline, etc.).

1. Click on the **interactions (1)** container to expand it, then click **Items (2)** underneath it.

1. Click on any item in the list to open its **JSON document (3)** in the right pane. Verify that:

   - The `user_id` field shows `"sarah_demo_cosmos"` — matching the `USER_ID` set in the notebook.
   - The document contains the actual conversation text from Task 3.2.

   > **Note:** In Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, every piece of data is stored as a JSON document inside a **container** (similar to a table in SQL, but schema-free). Each document has a unique `id` and a `partition key` — in this project, the partition key is the `user_id`, which means all of Sarah's data is grouped together for efficient retrieval.

1. Click on the **insights (1)** container → **Items (2)** and open one of the insight documents. Confirm it contains a fact extracted from the conversation — for example, Sarah's risk tolerance or income level.

1. Now verify **cross-run persistence** — this is the most important part. Return to Visual Studio Code, and **restart the notebook kernel** by clicking the **Restart** button in the notebook toolbar.

1. Run only the first two cells again (Cell 1 — imports/setup, Cell 2 — tools/session runner) to reinitialize the environment. Do **not** run the main demo cell yet.

1. Open a new notebook code cell at the bottom and run the following snippet to confirm prior data is accessible immediately after a fresh kernel start:

   ```python
   result = await memory.search("What is Sarah's risk tolerance?")
   print(result)
   ```

   Confirm the answer references Sarah's moderate-to-high risk profile from Session 1 — even though this is a brand-new kernel process that has never run the demo sessions. The data is coming from Cosmos DB, not from any in-memory state.

   > **Note:** This is the key difference from SQLite: with SQLite, persistence is local to the machine. With Cosmos DB, a completely separate application running anywhere — a web API, a mobile app, another engineer's laptop — would get the same answer from the same data.

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
> - Scroll down in the lab guide and hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
> - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.

## Task 3.4: Run Itemized Insights with Cosmos DB

In this task, you will run the `09_itemized_insights_cosmos.ipynb` notebook. This notebook introduces a more advanced memory concept: **bounded long-term memory** — a system where the agent can only keep a fixed number of insights at any time, and older or less-used insights are automatically removed to make room for newer, more relevant ones.

### Why bounded memory?

Imagine an agent that has been talking to a user for two years. If every insight from every session accumulates forever, the agent's memory grows without limit — eventually injecting so much context into every prompt that it becomes slow, expensive, and noisy. Bounded memory solves this by applying three scoring rules to decide which insights to keep:

- **Recency** — a new insight gets a temporary priority boost so it is not immediately dropped.
- **Frequency** — an insight that is referenced again in later sessions gets stronger (its `access_count` rises).
- **Forgetting** — an insight that is never referenced again gradually decays and is eventually pruned.

This notebook simulates six months of client sessions, capped at `MAX_INSIGHTS = 5`, and shows how the insight table evolves over time.

1. In the Explorer pane, open the **09_itemized_insights_cosmos.ipynb** notebook and select the same kernel as before.

1. Read the first markdown cell, **"Long-Term Memory Prioritization Demo (CosmosDB)"**. It introduces the four key concepts:

   - **Recency** — newer insights receive a temporary priority boost.
   - **Frequency** — cited/reused insights grow stronger over time.
   - **Forgetting** — old unused insights decay.
   - **Bounded memory** — only the top `MAX_INSIGHTS` (5) insights are retained at any time.

1. Run the first code cell (**Cell 1 — Imports, Config, and Timeline**). This cell:

   - **Loads your `.env` file** and resolves the project root.
   - **Imports the low-level Cosmos DB classes** directly — `CosmosDBDatabase`, `Reflection`, `LongTermInsightItem`, `rank_insights`, `calculate_retention_score`. Unlike the previous notebook, this demo bypasses the `AgentMemory` wrapper and works directly with the database and reflection engine to give you full visibility into the scoring system.
   - **Sets `USER_ID = "memory_priority_demo_cosmos"`** and **`MAX_INSIGHTS = 5`**.
   - **Defines the TIMELINE** — six pre-scripted sessions for a user called Alex, simulated across January–June 2025:
     - Month 1: Alex is 28, earns $120k, very risk-averse due to 2008 family losses, interested in Roth IRA.
     - Month 2: Alex opens a Roth IRA, still conservative (money market fund).
     - Month 3: Tax season questions, plans to max out the Roth IRA.
     - Months 4–6: Alex's situation and preferences evolve — watch how the insight table changes.

   You should see: `[Setup complete]` or equivalent output.

1. Run the second code cell (**Cell 2 — Helper Functions**). This cell defines the utility functions the main demo uses:

   - **`print_insight_table(items, now, title)`** — prints a formatted table of current insights showing their `ID`, `Score` (retention score), `Access` count (how many times they have been cited), `Age`, `Importance`, and the first 38 characters of the insight text. You will see this table printed before and after every session in the main run.
   - **`get_insight_items(db, user_id)`** — queries Cosmos DB for all stored long-term insight items for the user.
   - **`cleanup_demo_data(db, user_id)`** — deletes all existing insights for the demo user so each run starts clean.
   - **`prune_insights(db, user_id, items, max_items, now)`** — the core **bounded memory function**: ranks all insights by their retention score and deletes any beyond `MAX_INSIGHTS`. Pruned items are permanently removed from Cosmos DB.

   You should see: no output (this cell only defines functions, it does not run anything yet).

1. Read the markdown cell **"Cell 4: What Happens During Execution"** — it walks through the five steps of the main run before you execute it. Read all five steps so you understand what you are about to see.

1. Run the final code cell (**Cell 4 — Main Demo**). Watch the output section by section — it is long, but each section tells a clear story:

   **Connection:**
   - The cell connects to Cosmos DB using your credentials and calls `cleanup_demo_data()` to delete any prior insights for this demo user — ensuring a clean run.
   - You should see: `[Connecting to Azure CosmosDB...]` followed by `[Connected successfully]`.

   **For each of the six sessions, watch for this pattern:**

   *Before the session:*
   ```
   Memory State BEFORE Session:
   ID         Score  Access      Age  Importance   Text
   ...
   ```
   This table shows exactly which insights are in Cosmos DB **before** this session processes. In Session 1 (Month 1) it will say `[No existing insights - this is the first session]`.

   *During the session:*
   - `[Processing session...]` — the notebook sends the session's turns to the reflection engine to extract new insights.
   - `New insights: N` — how many new insights were extracted from this session.
   - Each new insight is printed with its generated ID and the first 50 characters of its text.
   - `Cited existing: [...]` — which prior insight IDs were referenced in this session (these get their `access_count` incremented, making them stronger).

   *After the session — the pruning decision:*
   Once the insight count exceeds `MAX_INSIGHTS = 5`, the notebook prints which insights were **kept** and which were **pruned** (removed from Cosmos DB). Look for lines like:
   ```
   BOUNDED MEMORY: 6 insights → kept 5, pruned 1
   Pruned (low retention score): [insight ID]
   ```

   **By Session 6**, compare the insight table to what it was after Session 1 — you will see that:
   - Insights about Alex's early risk-averse stance may have decayed and been pruned.
   - Insights that were repeatedly referenced (like the Roth IRA) have high `access_count` scores and remain.
   - The agent's memory is now a curated, scored representation of what matters most about Alex — not a raw dump of everything that was ever said.

1. After the main run completes, return to the **Azure Portal Data Explorer** and refresh the **insights** container. Confirm that exactly **5** (or fewer) insight documents exist for `user_id = "memory_priority_demo_cosmos"` — the pruning was real, not just simulated.

1. Compare the two notebooks by verifying the following differences in the output:

   - **`04_cosmosdb.ipynb`** — insights accumulate without a cap. The `get_insights()` call at the end shows every insight extracted across all sessions.
   - **`09_itemized_insights_cosmos.ipynb`** — the insight count never exceeds `MAX_INSIGHTS = 5`. Older, less-referenced insights are physically deleted from Cosmos DB.

## Task 3.5: Concept Check — Backend Selection Trade-offs

In this task, you will verify the four supported backends in the project's codebase, review a complete comparison table, and confirm why Cosmos DB is the right intermediate step between a local prototype and a production deployment.

### Step 1 — Verify the four backend types in the code

1. In Visual Studio Code Explorer pane, navigate to **memory/db/** and open the file that defines the `DatabaseType` enum (look for a file named `__init__.py`, `factory.py`, or similar).

1. Confirm the four accepted values appear in the code:

   ```python
   class DatabaseType(str, Enum):
       SQLITE = "sqlite"
       COSMOSDB = "cosmosdb"
       AZURE_AI_SEARCH = "azure_ai_search"
       POSTGRESQL = "postgresql"
   ```

   > **Note:** The exact file name may vary between repo versions. Use **CTRL + SHIFT + F** in VS Code to search across all files for `DatabaseType` if you cannot find it immediately.

### Step 2 — Review the backend comparison

Review the following table. Verify each row against your direct experience from Exercises 1, 2, and 3:

| Backend | Where data lives | Best fit | Strength | Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SQLite** | A `.db` file on your local machine | Local dev, demos, single-machine prototyping | Zero configuration — works immediately with no credentials | Data is tied to one machine; no other app or user can access it |
| **Cosmos DB** | Azure cloud — managed JSON document store | Production agents, multi-session apps, cloud deployments | Durable cloud persistence, globally available, JSON-native, serverless option | Requires Azure credentials and incurs cloud cost |
| **Azure AI Search** | Azure cloud — search-optimized index | When semantic/vector retrieval quality is the priority | Best-in-class hybrid (keyword + vector) retrieval | Higher setup complexity; less suited as a general-purpose store |
| **PostgreSQL** | SQL database (local or cloud-hosted) | Teams already standardizing on relational storage | Familiar SQL tooling, strong operational ecosystem | Requires schema management; less natural for JSON/vector workloads |

### Step 3 — Verify Cosmos DB as the practical intermediate step

1. In the Explorer pane, open the **04_cosmosdb.ipynb** notebook and locate Cell 4 again. Find this line:

   ```python
   db_type=DatabaseType.COSMOSDB,
   ```

1. Confirm that **every other line** in the `AgentMemory(...)` constructor — `user_id`, `openai_client`, `config` — is identical to what you would write for `DatabaseType.SQLITE`. The only change is one argument.

1. This is what makes Cosmos DB the right intermediate step:

   - You write your agent code against the local SQLite backend — no cloud costs, instant feedback.
   - When you are ready to deploy, you change **one line** to `db_type=DatabaseType.COSMOSDB` and provide credentials.
   - Your agent code, memory logic, session management, and insight curation all continue working unchanged.

1. Confirm this by locating the SQLite initialization from Exercise 1's notebook (**01_basic_memory.ipynb**, Cell 2) alongside the Cosmos DB initialization in this exercise — place them side by side in split view (**right-click the tab → Split Right**) and verify that the only difference is the `db_type` argument and the Cosmos DB connection string.

## 🧾 Summary

In this exercise, you accomplished the following:

- Understood the difference between the four supported backends (SQLite, Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, PostgreSQL) and when to choose each one
- Verified the Cosmos DB endpoint and key in your `.env` file and navigated to the pre-provisioned Cosmos DB account in the Azure Portal
- Ran the `04_cosmosdb.ipynb` notebook and observed the three-session financial advisor scenario with cloud-backed memory — watching the `Memory context loaded` size grow from Session 1 to Session 3 as Sarah's profile accumulated
- Confirmed persistence was real by browsing the `interactions`, `session_summaries`, and `insights` containers in Data Explorer, inspecting the raw JSON documents, and verifying that a fresh kernel restart could still recall Sarah's risk tolerance from Cosmos DB
- Ran the `09_itemized_insights_cosmos.ipynb` notebook and observed the bounded memory system — six simulated monthly sessions, a hard cap of `MAX_INSIGHTS = 5`, and the pruning function removing lower-scored insights from Cosmos DB in real time, with the scoring driven by recency, frequency of citation, and forgetting decay
- Confirmed in Data Explorer that exactly 5 (or fewer) insight documents remained after the bounded demo, proving that pruning is a real cloud database operation — not just a display filter
- Verified that switching from SQLite to Cosmos DB requires changing exactly one argument (`db_type=DatabaseType.COSMOSDB`) with all agent and memory logic unchanged
